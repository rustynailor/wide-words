# Wide Words
*Repository for final Nanodegree Capstone Project - an Android game to learn difficult words.*

The writer Will Self is renowned for deploying his vast, esoteric vocabulary throughout his novels and newspaper columns. A self described sesquipedalian (lover of obscure language), he argues persuasively that we could all benefit from being less risk-averse in our choice of words. This app is designed to help the user do just that - embrace a wider world of words. 

Defintions for words are sourced from the open source WordNet project: http://wordnet.princeton.edu/
